# Sheldon's Game

* Appearing in the TV Show, the Big Bang Theory, this novel twist on the classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors adds two new elements of Lizard and Spock.
* In this game the user will be able to choose between the five elements as they attempt to beat the computer which is selecting at random.
